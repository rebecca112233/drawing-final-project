# Drawing On the Web Final Project
Created using CSS animations.

## Outline
I want to create three flat landscape scenes that have moving properties with time. I t hought it would be fun to do three vastly different landscapes, so for now, I have settled on mountains, an underwater scene, and a cityscape. Overall, because there will be a lot of different shapes, I am thinking that I will create SVGs using Illustrator for the different components, and then animate them using JavaScript and CSS.

### 1. First Drawing (Mountains)
For the mountains, I am doing three mountain peaks, some trees, and then a few slow moving clouds. These clouds will move across the page and disappear, and then it will start over. 

### 2. Second Drawing (Underwater)
For the underwater scene, I thought it would be cool to have some general shapes of rocks and sand dunes, and fish moving back and forth on the screen. 

### 3. Third Drawing (City)
For the city one, I am going to have a lot of differently sized buildings. I plan to do it somewhat like a timelapse, because the ciy is so fast moving. I want to have it transition from day to night, have the sun set, the moon rise, the colors in the sky change, and light up the windows in the buildings. However, I'm not sure if this is entirely possible in my time frame, because there are so many bits to change, especially the lights in the windows. If I don't get to do a slow transition of lights in the buildings, I can also directly light them up once it turns to night.

Alternatively, I could do just a night scene and have the stars twinkle and do more with random lights in the windows of buildings turning on. I think this one will just have to be more of a trial and error.
